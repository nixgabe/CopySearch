# CopySearch
A small program written as an assignment for my internship. It searches folders for copies based on matching file names and file sizes and lists these. Offering the opportunity to expand on found files to see where the copies are placed within the given folder.

It's been updated as of 3rd of June with some changes.
1. Main file has been cleaned up further and now has more of it's logic put in various functions to keep the main file as small and clean as possible now with only 19 lines. 
2. Did a check for some more leftover comments and text remnants in Swedish, I think I've managed to find all pieces that needed translation. 
3. Swapped out some of the if functions to switch case. 
4. Added a function so it ignores duplicate folders and doesn't save them in the list. Now the program only saves the actual files that it finds.
