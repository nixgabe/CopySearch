# CopySearch
A small program written as an assignment for my internship. It searches folders for copies based on matching file names and file sizes and lists these. Offering the opportunity to expand on found files to see where the copies are placed within the given folder.

I may revisit this at some point because I feel like there could be some minor changes to remove duplicate code.
